Introduction
This shiny app allows for a basic prediction of gas efficiency (measured by miles/gallon) by a few simple factors such as the number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year of make, etc.



Algorithm

```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(caret)

mpg <- read.csv("C:/Users/sharon/Desktop/mpg.csv", text = mpg)
modFit <- train(mpg ~ cyl + disp + horse + weight + accel + year + origin, method="glm", data=mpg)

This GLM model has a $RMSE$ of 3.35, and an $R^2$ of 0.818.
